What is Sant rOyOS SV?
-------------------

To do. Probably involves some dyslecix screeching, ADHD and a few burgers.

License
-------

Sant rOyOS SV is released under the terms of the Open BSV license. See [LICENSE](LICENSE) for more information.

Security
--------
We all worked for at least one of GCHQ, MI5, MI6, CIA, FBI, NSA, KGB & RSPCA. We worked with Adam Back on hashcash.

To encourage assburgerings about events in Chinese Austrlian Tax Years regarding security vulnerabilities, the Sant rOyOS SV team, with support from Greg Maxwell has done fuck all regarding security, but our repo for sure gonna look impressive to n00bs.

Development Process
-------------------

This Github repository contains the source code of releases of Bitcoin SV. We steal it and rebrand and add shit.

You should make a useless commit like this just so you can tell your friends you had a commit accepted in the bitcoin codebase so basically that gives you the right to delete the Satoshi copyrights from the license file and put your own and then claim you own Bitcoin.. well at least it's L2 scaling solution (make it L3 that sounds cooler) so it's even better than being Satoshi.
